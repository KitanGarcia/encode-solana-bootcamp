1. Follow the instructions from the lesson and use the spl-token-cli to create
  a) A fungible token with a supply of 10,000:
    spl-token create-token
    spl-token create-account <TOKEN_ID>
    spl-token mint <TOKEN_ID> 10000

  b) An NFT:
    spl-token create-token --decimals 0
    spl-token create-account <TOKEN_ID>
    spl-token mint <TOKEN_ID> 1 <ACCOUNT_ID>
    spl-token authorize <TOKEN_ID> mint --disable

2. Try sending these tokens to others in your team , and use the command line to find details about the tokens.
  Use --fund-recipient if recipient's associated token account does not exist
  1. Fungible Token
    spl-token transfer <TOKEN_ID> 2000 <DESTINATION_ADDRESS> --fund-recipient

  2. NFT
    spl-token transfer <TOKEN_ID> 1 <DESTINATION_ADDRESS> --fund-recipient
